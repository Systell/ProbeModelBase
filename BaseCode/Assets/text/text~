It feels like your village has been in a state of constant bickering and dispute for an eternity. Only Gary the Oblivious seems unaffected from the turmoil. As voices prattle on, your mind drifts to memories of falling asleep as a child. You remember how the soothiness of the waves crashing on the beach competed with the terror of the distant inhuman growls of the Island Monsters. Your memory makes a violent shift to a few months ago when a monster crossed the channel. Its eyes were pits of cold hatred. Mercy did not swerve the path of its destruction. Since then, the village has hotly debated paying for a bridge to be built to the island for the royal army to cross and kill off the monsters. Do we risk our lives to the monsters, or indebt them to the Corrupt King?

The village finally decides to take a vote on whether to build the bridge. Of the 99 villagers, 49 raise their hand to build the bridge. Then Gary the Oblivious slowly raises his hand, confusion spread across his face. The decision passes. You feel relief as the dispute is finally over. A messenger takes some gold and heads off to the guilds. Awhile later, some officers of the royal army arrive to witness the village's choice. They ask who votes to bring in the army. Again, 49 hands shoot into the air. All the villagers turn to Gary, only to be met with a vacant stare. The officers decide the vote has failed and leave.

The monsters cross the bridge and everyone is slaughtered, except Gary. Dammit, Gary!

As you can see in the simulation below, what Gary has done is exposed a fundamental flaw of the voting system the village used. The next page will expain its problem dealing with dependencies.
